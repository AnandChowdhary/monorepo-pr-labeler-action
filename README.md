# ðŸšŠ Monorepo PR Repo Labeler - GitHub Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that labels pull requests with the repo(s) that they impact for [monorepos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo).

## How It Works

This GitHub Action runs when an [`pull_request` event webhook](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#issuesevent) is fired in your GitHub repo. The action checks if any of the files in the pull request are in a monorepo repo (ex. `/directory/...` from the root of the monorepo). If one or more monorepos are found, the pull request is labeled with a label for each monorepo repo. Directories that beging with a dot (ex. `/.directory/`) are ignored.

## Examples

## Installation

To use this GitHub Action, you must have access to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). GitHub Actions are currently only available in private beta (you must [apply for access](https://github.com/features/actions)) and only work in private repos.

To setup this action:

1. Create a `.github/main.workflow` in your GitHub repo.
2. Add the following code to the `main.workflow` file and commit it to the repo's `master` branch.

```
workflow "Monorepo PR Repo Labeler" {
  resolves = ["Label PR"]
  on = "pull_request"
}

action "Label PR" {
  uses = "adamzolyak/monorepo-pr-labeler-action@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```

3. Whenever you open, edit, close, etc a pull request, the action will run!
